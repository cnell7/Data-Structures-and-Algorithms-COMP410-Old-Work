These assignments were done to learn data structures and algorithms. I've included the grade I got for every assignment to show you how well I was able to code the data structure/algorithm when I was learning it. The score does not == my current knowledge of that data structure; these were made first semester sophomore year as I was learning about these concepts for the first time.

Assignment 1: LIST implemented at linked cells (94.00 (max 100.00))
Assignment 2: Binary Search Tree (74.00 (max 90.00))
Assignment 3: Priority Queue and Binary Heap (70.80 (max 100.00))
Assignment 4: Splay tree (98.00 (max 100.00))
Assignment 5: Directed Graph and Dijkstra's Shortest Path (91.20 (max 100.00))
